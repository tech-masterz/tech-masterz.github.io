    <h1>Privacy Policy for Boxing Trainer VR</h1>

    <p>Last updated: [Date]</p>

    <p>Welcome to Boxing Trainer VR. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information that may be collected, used, and disclosed while you use our application. By using Boxing Trainer VR, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>

    <p>Currently, Boxing Trainer VR does not collect, process, or store any personal data, user information, or device information. The game operates entirely offline, and there is no internet connection required or used.</p>

    <h2>2. Future Data Collection</h2>

    <p>In the future, Boxing Trainer VR may introduce an optional leaderboard feature. If this feature is implemented, the application will request to collect only the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>Game score</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This information would be used solely to display player standings on the leaderboard and will not be shared with third parties. No other personal information, such as email, location, or device details, will be collected.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Use</h2>

    <p>If the leaderboard feature is implemented, the data collected (username and score) will be used solely to rank players and display scores in the applicationâ€™s leaderboard. This information will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>

    <p>All data related to the leaderboard will be securely stored. We will take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. Data will only be retained as long as necessary to support the leaderboard feature.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>

    <p>If the leaderboard feature is introduced, players can request to delete their username and score from the leaderboard at any time by contacting our support team. We will process deletion requests within a reasonable time frame. No fees will be charged for data deletion.</p>

    <p>In cases where deletion requests cannot be fulfilled, we will provide a justification, such as data being essential for maintaining leaderboard functionality. However, this scenario is highly unlikely given our limited data requirements.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be modified accordingly. Continued use of the app after changes signifies acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>

    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or data deletion requests, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@boxingtrainervr.com">support@boxingtrainervr.com</a>.</p>
