    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information that may be collected, used, and disclosed while you use our application. By using Boxing Trainer VR, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>

    <p>Boxing Trainer VR only accesses your basic user info, including your name, user id, score, username and avatar for the leaderboard.
        The data is not sent or stored by any of our servers and is solely processed for the reason of leaderboard ranking.
        However, there is no internet connection required for the game to function (except for updating the leaderboard).</p>

    <h2>2. Data Use</h2>

    <p>The data collected (id, username and score) is used solely to rank players and display scores in the applicationâ€™s leaderboard.
        This information will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
    
    <p>This information would be used solely to display player standings on the leaderboard and will not be shared with third parties. No other personal information, such as email, location, or device details, will be collected and stored in our servers.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>

    <p>All data related to the leaderboard is stored by Meta, and is loaded from Meta servers during the game.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>

    <p>If a user deletes their Meta account, their username and score will be deleted from the leaderboard
        without the need for any manual request in our game or website.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be modified accordingly. Continued use of the app after changes signifies acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
